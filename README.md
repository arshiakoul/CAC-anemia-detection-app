## üìò Abstract
Anemia affects over 1.6 billion people worldwide, yet diagnosis often relies on invasive blood tests unavailable in many low-resource regions.  
Our project leverages deep learning to detect early signs of anemia from simple **eye images (conjunctiva region)** using a lightweight **ResNet50-based convolutional neural network (CNN)**.  
The goal is to provide a **non-invasive, accessible screening tool** that could eventually be deployed on mobile devices to assist early diagnosis.

## üí° Motivation & Problem Statement
Fellow students, friends, family, and teachers who suffer from anemia in our community, exacerbated by Colorado's elevation and climate, inspired us to create a diagnoses tool to detect anemia earler so nobody has to experience unexplained dizziness and fatigue.
We explored whether **visible physiological markers**, like the redness or paleness of the lower eyelid (conjunctiva), could be analyzed by an AI model to predict anemia risk quickly and non-invasively.
